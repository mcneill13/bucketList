      What Do You Think?
      </ion-card-title>
    <p>
      Ridiculous questions with preset answers. Would you play a game of Russian Roullette for $10 million? Would you take a pill to  learn every language if it meant your life was cut in half?

      This vs That
      </ion-card-title>
    <p>
      Random questions and scenarios that pit one thing against another. Who would win in a mile race, Jon Snow or LeBron James? Who has better hair, Armin Van Buuren or Barack Obama?

      These can be deal-breakers for some people, just answers yes or no! If they were allergic to dogs? If they slept with their boss for a huge raise?
