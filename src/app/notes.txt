Inspect a tab for the new window, then run ionic cordova run android --device --livereload
settings files android data com.ionicframework files

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING A NEW DIRECTORY AND FILE ON ANDROID. THEN WRITING TO THAT FILE
console.log(this.file);
console.log(cordova.file);
this.file.createDir(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory, 'themDocs', true);
this.file.checkDir(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory, 'themDocs').then(_ => console.log('Directory exists1')).catch(err => console.log('Directory doesnt exist1'));
console.log(this.file.listDir(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory, ''));
this.file.createFile(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory + '/themDocs', 'abc.txt', true);
then you can use writeExistingFile: this.file.writeExistingFile(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory + '/themDocs', 'abc.txt', this.theJSON);  
to create a file AND write to it, use writeFile, I could not get that to work
Several read functions, i used: console.log(this.file.readAsText(cordova.file.externalDataDirectory + '/themDocs/', 'abc.txt'));

who would win
would you breakup
what do you think (questions book) (peed or yawned more)
